This is the first of two back-to-back full moons in Aquarius, and a turning point has arrived. Your intimate needs and the balance in your relationships will be discussed.This could also bring news about a large sum of money, perhaps in the form of a debt, loan, scholarship, venture capital, royalty check, or settlement.

Working in several facets of spirituality, body care, research, and expanding your mind, in general, is what 2021 is all about.

You are working out karmic cycles through learning your own patterns in communication and understanding what stories you've been told for far too long. You might even be faced with the truth about a family situation that you once spent far too much time trying to resolve. Maybe you've sacrificed your own happiness for the good of your loved ones only to come to terms with what you really want for yourself.\n\nThis is a year where you can really step into your own independence and gain a little emotional space from the judgments of others. There's a refreshing tone to your life once you accept the truth about something you've been stuffing under the rug. 2021, in general, is a time for you to face the music, and see how special you really are!

You might even consider directing your energy towards more humanitarian causes as Saturn's presence in Aquarius trines your sign and connects you to several causes that you feel most passionate about.\n\nYou are a sign that seeks diplomacy and justice, which you know does not happen overnight. You are willing to put in the time and effort to really see certain things through and know that this is a full-year process ahead. You might even consider volunteering your time with certain organizations, and find yourself continually inspired by the stories of others as you deepen your understanding and research within your community.\n\nA very enlightening lesson this year includes the cycles of Mercury retrograde, which are all in air signs. This begins with an Aquarian retrograde during the months of January and February, creating an editing period for your fifth house, affecting your children and creative talents. As Mercury retrograde asks us all to investigate things more deeply, this is also an important lesson for all your relationships.\n\nYou'll feel more challenged by a Gemini retrograde cycle from May through early July. This can be a bit tricky in your communication style, and bring unwanted confusion. The year also brings a healing Mercury retrograde in your sign of the Scales from late September through mid-November.\n\nIn general, there's a lot of activity in the second half of the year in terms of questions and resolutions involving love.\n",

If there are any relationship traumas or fears bubbling beneath the surface, you can work through them now so that you don\u2019t have to hold onto vulnerability or trust issues.This same energy could also be increasing your expenses, because the solar eighth house holds ties to large sums of money in the form of debts or loans.The sun and Mercury spend most of the month smiling at you from across the sky.The sweet new moon on the ninth, spinning in her dazzling white dress, reaches out her hand to you, encouraging you to make promises and commitments to your significant partner in love or business. Some coupled Capricorns may make long-term plans together, move in, get engaged, or even marry. Single Capricorns can also utilize this energy to put themselves out there and set up meetings with prospective suitors who seem to have serious potential.Later in the month, a full moon in Aquarius and your solar second house of finances appears on  23. This lunation could bring a shift around money matters, perhaps a large expense, the end of a job, or perhaps a raise. This is the first in two back-to-back full moons in this arena, so while this first one could bring more heavy news than you\u2019d like, the rest of the year looks more favorable for your financial life.Standout days: 5, 15, 20Challenging days: 1, 8, 17",

The presence of your home planet Saturn through the sign of Aquarius is in full force this year, and has many lessons for your sign of the Goat to take in and process.\n\nThere is some element of psychology pulling at you, which requires you to be wise beyond your years. You are experiencing a new world for yourself, and might even long for things to go back to the way they were. But the innovative influence of Aquarius will have you feeling more emotionally detached from your partnerships and friendships, pulling you into the future!\n\nAs a sign who often puts work over love, this can be a little easier for those Goats who just want some energy to jump into their professional life with zero constraints. For those who are ignoring your relationship duties because work gets in the way, this is a year where you can truly come face-to-face in this respect, and be open about your feelings.\n\nThere is some pattern that needs to be reassessed in your overall life. The difficult square between Saturn in Aquarius and Uranus in Taurus takes you away from the original structure you once perceived to be the rules, and now asks you to be a little more radical and step out of your own way. The turning points this year are not limited to mid-February, mid-June, and late December, but do bring on these squares in strong. This is a lesson that will test your self-esteem, but that is meant to cleanse your second chakra of creativity.\n",

Luckily, facing reality now can be a healing experience.Your naughty side comes out during the sun-Pluto opposition over the weekend, and it might point you in the direction of people who aren\u2019t the best for you.
